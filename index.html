        <h1><em>BREAKING NEWS:</em> DONQUIXOTE BUYS TWITTER</h1>

        <p>The WENP has just received reports that, as of this morning, Donquixote Doflamingo, billionaire King of
            Dressrosa and current Warlord, has just purchased the Social Media company, Twitter, for 44 Billion Beri.
        </p>
        <p>The known Privateer and beloved Monarch has reportedly already let go of the former staff and replaced them
            with trusted insiders. Rumors of the to be announced replacements include new Chief of Infrastructure, Pica.
            Pica, longtime friend and business ally to Donquixote is an unconventional choice, for though his background
            is in infrastructure as the Chief of Operations Spade Executive of Donquixote Industries, it is of the
            physical variety. We’re not sure what building physical buildings will bring to the table when making
            decisions about digital infrastructure, but it will likely include a pivot to Web3, as Pica is an early
            investor in Flamincoin and NFTs. </p>
        <p>That is not the most controversial choice however, as many have predicted that Donquixote is appointing
            Trebol, another longtime supporter and current Chief Financial Officer of Donquixote Industries (the beloved
            Head of Clubs) to oversee the company’s content moderation and user base. Trebol has made headlines over the
            last ten years numerous times for making adversarial public statements, not the least of which have been
            aimed at Donquixote’s own brother, who was killed in a drug bust (<a
                href="https://youtu.be/RSe8D2wfGKI?t=29">see next article</a>) thirteen years prior.
        </p>
        <p>Diamante, former rock star and lead singer of the group Zerosmith, will be assuming the role of Chief
            Communications Officer, and has only issued the following statement over the sudden acquisition: “He who
            owns the News owns the World, and Doffy is going to be King!” </p>
        <p>Our reporters on the ground in Dressrosa, spoke to a few of the locals. “We’re all toys in his toybox!” said
            one Toy Soldier, outraged. He’s been an outspoken critic of the Monarch since his installment a little over
            a decade ago. Other citizens however, seem quite enthused over the prospect of Donquixote’s new ownership.
            “It’s about time! He’s the king of entertainment, I mean, look what he did with the Coliseum here! That’s
            just the kind of leadership Twitter needs! Gladiator style fights, blood sports in cyberspace!” said one
            man, who asked to remain anonymous. </p>
        <p>The buyout is especially unexpected as, just last night, the multinational conglomerate, Baroque Works,
            headed by company President Sir Crocodile was in the offering stages of purchasing the troubled social media
            network. “We found a better venture to suit our needs,” was the only statement WENP was given. Could this be
            the start-up, Cross Guild, that Sir Crocodile announced earlier this year? The jury is still out.</p>
        <p>Well readers, only time will tell how this move goes for the billionaire playboy. What new features would you
            like to see him implement on Twitter?</p>
